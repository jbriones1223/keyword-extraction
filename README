FILES:
grabber.py - 
    Basic script to pull text from a file which is specified at compile time.
    This script implements two basic keyword extraction methods: POS tagging and
    selectivity. The POS tagging approach selects the most frequent nouns, while
    the selectivity approach chooses words based on adjacency within a sentence.
    In both cases, stopwords are removed, but this really only effects the
    selectivity approach, because the POS tagging only selects nouns anyway.

twitter_as_data.txt -
    Section 1 of the Twitter as Data article by Professor Alvarez. Medium-sized
    text file for testing. Note that at this point, this is mainly for error
    checking, as only including the first section will eliminate some potential
    keywords occurring in other sections.




MOVING FORWARD:
    - consider adding other word types to the POS approach
    - deal with punctuation in a sentence (possibly split it into two different
        sentences?
    - implement other approaches, now that the basics are implemented
