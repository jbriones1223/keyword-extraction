FILES:
grabber.py - 
    Basic script to pull text from a file which is specified at compile time.
    This script implements two basic keyword extraction methods: POS tagging and
    selectivity. The POS tagging approach selects the most frequent nouns, while
    the selectivity approach chooses words based on adjacency within a sentence.
    In both cases, stopwords are removed, but this really only effects the
    selectivity approach, because the POS tagging only selects nouns anyway.

grabber2.py -
    Similar to grabber.py, with a different input file. The file should be a csv
    containing the full content of tweets, minus any non-ascii characters. Note
    that this is currently very slow for large datasets. It took a few minutes
    to run on 10,000 tweets. This correlates to the size of the .csv file, not
    just how many tweets within the file we eliminate. For this reason, the file
    was generated with:

        > dat <- readRDS(rds_file)
        > write.csv(lapply(dat$full_content[1:10000], fixUTF), csv_file)

    I'm going to see what I can do to speed it up, but for now just be aware of
    the amount of data.
    
    fixUTF has the following definition:

        fixUTF <- function(tweet){
            tweetInt <- utf8ToInt(tweet)
            probInt <- which(tweetInt > 127)
            if(length(probInt) > 0){
                tweetInt <- tweetInt[-probInt]
            }
            return(intToUtf8(tweetInt))
        }

twitter_as_data.txt -
    Section 1 of the Twitter as Data article by Professor Alvarez. Medium-sized
    text file for testing. Note that at this point, this is mainly for error
    checking, as only including the first section will eliminate some potential
    keywords occurring in other sections.




MOVING FORWARD:
    - consider adding other word types to the POS approach
    - deal with parentheticals in a sentence (possibly split it into two
        different sentences?
    - implement other approaches, now that the basics are implemented
